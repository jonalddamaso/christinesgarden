step by step (New Branch)
	
	GIT branching
	1. git init
		(initialize your local git repo)
	2. create a repository in gitlab. (new project in gitlab)

	Create the dev branch
	3. git checkout -b dev
		(creates a dev branch where you will make ALL your changes and updates.)
	4. git branch
		(to check what branch you are in)
	5. git status
		(to check what files haven't been added yet)
	6. git add -A
		(to add the files in the folder)
	7. git remote add <alias> <url from gitlab>
		(adds the remote repo from gitlab)
	8. git commit -m "<message>"
		(commits all the changes done)

------All your commits/progress will be in your dev branch while your "pushes" will take place in your staging(gitlab) and prod(github) branches


------------------------
	Create the staging branch

	1. git checkout -b staging
		(creates your staging branch)
	2. git branch
		(check what branch you are in)
	3. git checkout staging
		(change current branch to staging)
	4. git merge dev
		(copies the content of the dev branch to staging)
			(syntax: in destination branch: git merge source)
	5. git commit -m "<message>"
		(commits all changes in staging branch)
	6. git remote -v
		(checks all the repos and alias defined)
	7. git push <alias> staging
		(pushes staging contents to remote repo)
