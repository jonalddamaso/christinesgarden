Note: this assumes you already have setup your branches and remote repository.

	Start of Work:

	1. git checkout staging
		(change current branch to staging)
	2. git pull <alias> staging
		(pull from gitlab to staging)
	3. git checkout dev
		(changes current branch to dev)
	4. git merge staging
		(merges staging content to dev)
	5. Code in dev branch.

	End of work:

	1. git branch
		(make sure you are still on the dev branch)
	2. git add -A
		(add all the files changed)
	3. git commit -m "<message>"
		(commit all changes done)
	4. git status
		(makes sure that all the files are there)
	5. git checkout staging
	
	6. git merge dev
		(copies dev content to staging)
	7. git commit -m "<message>"
		(commits all changes in staging)
	8. git push <alias> staging
		(pushes all changes from staging to remote repo)


Do this only once at home before doing start of work:
	
	1. git init
	2. git checkout -b dev
	3. git checkout -b staging
	4. proceed to "start of work" steps
